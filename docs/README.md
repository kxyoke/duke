### Feature 1 : Add, show and delete tasks
You can create tasks that are either todos, events or tasks with deadlines. Each task will have a brief description and whether it has been completed or not. Tasks can optionally have notes, which will be added later on after initial creation of the task. Created tasks can be listed.
When a task is no longer relevant, you can delete it as well, which removes it from memory and will not be retrievable.
### Feature 2 : Save and load past tasks
Eva will save your created data and load any available data when you start up Eeeva.
### Feature 3: Mark tasks as done
You can mark tasks as done and Eva will remember and indicate that it is completed.
### Feature 4: Find tasks
You can search for tasks using keywords and Eva will list out the matching tasks.
### Feature 5: Add notes
If you have additional notes you want to supplement to tasks, you can add them after creating those tasks. These task notes will be displayed together with the task.
Alternatively, if you wish to add general notes to remind you of general things not related to just a single task, you can add general notes as well.
